# PyNotes for Environmental Scientistss

<a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/181793782"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/181793782.svg" alt="DOI"><a>

A hands-on set of python notebooks intended for students that have little or no programming experience and are interested in acquiring basic programming skills. The Python notes focus on understanding programming logic by developing codes for automating and increasing the reproducibility of common tasks in plant and soil sciences.

## Interactive resources

[Interactive notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andres-patrignani/pynotes/master?filepath=notebooks)
(It make take few seconds to few minutes to load the interactive notebooks. For a quick reference consider exploring the Github repository or the PyNotes documentation.)


## Loading datasets

The datasets used along these notebooks can be found in the `/datasets` directory of the Github repository. Throughout the examples it is assumed that the Python interpreter of the Jupyter notebook is in the `pynotes/notebooks` directory, reason why the directories are relative to this path in the exercises, for example: `pd.read_csv("../datasets/file.csv")`.

If you want to follow along an exercise without downloading the entire material, you can always read the data directly from the Github repository, just make sure you get the URL link for the "Raw" data. For example, to read the Anscombe's dataset:

`pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andres-patrignani/pynotes/master/datasets/anscombe_quartet.csv')`

Follow this video to learn how to obtain the link for the raw data.
